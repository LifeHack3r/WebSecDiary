# WebSecDiary

Just a vault of Absolute RAW Notes I personally made while learning about different Web App Vulnerability Classes.
Everything is basically curated from already available resources from the Web. But just modified and combined in a way 
to help understand it in much simpler terms all from various places. The aim of this is to help someone with a similar mindset
or simply having difficulty in understanding the concepts, do so in an easier fashion. And I'll keep updating it.
